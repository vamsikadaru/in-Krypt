            <p>
                With In-Krypt, you get a portion of your monthly payment back to your crypto wallet in the form of crypto rewards (available in Ether Coin).

            <p>
                Unlike a traditional loan that takes your credit score into account, an In-Krypt loan is an asset-backed loan in which your cryptoassets act as collateral for your line of credit. Once you pay back your loan, we’ll return your assets to you.

            <h2>Highly Secured</h2>
            <p>
                Smart contract-based applications used for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) borrowing has a unique feature that lets you keep custody of your funds, but you can’t use them until you fully repay the loan.
